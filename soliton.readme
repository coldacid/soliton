Soliton 2.1 (2002-04-28)

Soliton is a Klondike and Freecell card game.
This program is GPL'ed software.

Features
--------

* Cardsets are loaded via datatypes. You can also make them
  easily by yourself using any size or color depth you like.
  Look at Aminet/game/data/ to find some alternative cardsets!

* Nice MUI user interface, runs on workbench or any other
  screen. Works on Cybergraphics and Picasso, too.

* Opaque drag'n'drop card movement.

* Background pattern.

* Supports REKO cards and zipped cardset files

Requirements
------------

* Kickstart 3.0 (or higher)
* MUI 3.6 (or higher)
* SDI reko.datatype (recommended)
* xadmaster.library (recommended)

See http://www.rekonet.org/ for cardsets and tools.

See http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/soliton/ for the development
site of this program.

Changes to last release 2.00
----------------------------

* Now it is GPL and thus freely distributable and usable.
* Development done using Soliton project at
  http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/soliton/
* Implemented much more localisation stuff.
* Changed highscore and profile data formats.
* Migrated code from C++ to plain C code and shortened
  the resulting files.
* Removed obsoleted code parts.
* Joined Freecell and Klondike code to use one unique code
  base. This also results in better statistics and more functions
  for Freecell variant.
* Joined both Soliton games completely.
* Now detects REKO-cardsets automatically (by size) and needs no
  longer the SOLITON keyword for reko.datatype.
* Fixed crash when double clicking on klondike stack card before
  clicking new button.
* When XAD system is installed, the cardsets maybe archived in
  any supported archive type (if there are multiple files in the
  archive, the largest one is taken).
* Fixed statistics overwrite bug.
