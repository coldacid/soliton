ToDo:
 - Make Freecell statistics compatible to Klondike.
 - Better statistics handling after game joining.
 - Make use of REKO backcards.
 - Auto select cardsets option (random, saved in profiles file).
   - After every x (option) games or
   - After every x (option) program start
 - Shorten path names for Loading display (or make it dynamic).
 - freecell options:
   - Lay cards only onto equal color (heart -- heart) instead onto
     different color
   - Start with x (option) cards on stack.
 - last stats place is always replaced even if it was better than
   new one?
 - Add somewhat nicer default cardset handling (images for numbers and
   signs internally)
 - get updated locale files and docs
 - fix refresh problems introduced in V2.1
   - wrong refresh on klondike stack in 3 cards mode, when only 2 cards
     come from hidden stack
   - switching gamemode does not refresh
 - move date generation to makefile (used in Main.c)
