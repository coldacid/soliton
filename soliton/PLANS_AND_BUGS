ToDo:
 - Make Freecell statistics compatible to Klondike.
 - Better statistics handling after game joining.
 - Auto select cardsets option (random, saved in profiles file).
   - After every x (option) games or
   - After every x (option) program start
 - Add somewhat nicer default cardset handling (images for numbers and
   signs internally)
 - get updated locale files and docs
 - move date generation to makefile (used in Main.c)
 - Add Freecell move button support
 - Do not add game to stats, when the settings were changed inbetween.
 - Add the game settings to score field.
 - cool buttons alternatively in footer and not left
 - Freecell game mode with 10 stacks (own gamemode)
   - This is really necessary with EqualColors option.
 - Including other solitaire game modes.

CSolitaire.c:
 - Split file into modules for every game, unify interface for different
   games (make more games addition really easy)
 - Extracting Operations into own module including undo-Handling:

enum UndoType {UNDOTYPE_UNCOVER, UNDOTYPE_MOVE, UNDOTYPE_UNCOVERMOVE};

struct UndoNode
{
  struct UndoNode *next;        /* pointer to next element */
  enum UndoType    type;        /* the type of operation */
  int              from;        /* source stack of move */
  int              to;          /* destination move stack */
  int              num;         /* number of transfered cards */
};

 - A special handling for source stack of klondike is needed.
